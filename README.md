# Bike Sales Transaction Project

## Data Cleaning
I removed duplicates.

I created many charts most of them were bar and line charts.

## Takeaways

**Road Bikes** and **Mountain Bikes** have the highest order.
**Accessories** orders big affect decline in bike sales. Because of bikes orders decrease from *2015*.
The best time to sell bike orders *2014* and *2016* in *June*.
